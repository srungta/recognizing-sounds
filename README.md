# Multi class- classigfication practice
## Recognizing-sounds

### Overview

The repository is primarily to practice classification of multi class data sets. A few side benefits will come as we proceed through the below checklist:

- [ ] **Classify various kinds of sound in a random video stream.**
- [ ] **Classify various kinds of sound in a controlled video stream.**
- [ ] **Classify various kinds of sound in a random sound stream.**
- [ ] **Classify various kinds of sound in a controlled sound stream.**
- [ ] **Classify discrete samples from test set.**
- [ ] **Classify discrete samples from test set.**
- [ ] **Document and plot accuracy for dev set.**
- [ ] **Build a NN around the train set.**
- [ ] **Divide dataset into training, dev and test sets.**
- [ ] **Prepare dataset for analysis.**
- [ ] **Set up repository and expectations.**


Each of these steps will in themselves requires multiples facets of programming. For every release, tick off one the above.

## Engineering practices.
1. Document what you do for each step.
2. Write scripts that are usable.
3. Write scripts that are readable.
4. Do not use libraries unless required.
5. Maintain codacy cleanliness.
